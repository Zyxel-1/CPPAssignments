# CS 02 - Assignments
  
In this course the C++ computer language is used to demonstrate methods of representing and manipulating data. The student will learn the object-oriented problem solving skills necessary to read, write, and correct complex computer programs, and to make important design decisions. Topics include lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching, sorting, modeling and algorithm analysis.

## Assignments

Each of the following assignments are as follows:

 - **Assignment 01** - This program is designed to add two integers together. Structure *BigInt*: Contains an array that stores and array of numbers with MAX_DIGITS being the array index and an int storing the number of digits stored in the said array.
 - **Assignment 02** - This program is designed to add two integers together.  Structure *BigInt*: Contains an array that stores and array of numbers with MAX_DIGITS being the array index and an int storing the number of digits stored in the said array. **Use Classes**
 - **Assignment 03** - Create a linear, sorted list from movie information stored in a text file. Enable the user to manipulate the list through a menu Class MovieType: Contains Movie data as private and functinos to display, compare, initilize, and read functions Class SortedMovieList:Contains sorted movie array and size as private, contains functions to manipulate the given array to add, remove, search, counts, and print all the data in private.
 - **Assignment 04** - Develop a program that will store, search, and print a list of names and phone numbers. The PhoneBook class must be implemented using a singly linked list. Each node in the list is a structure of type PhoneBookItem.
 - **Assignment 05** - Develop a program that will store students in a Binary Search Tree. Create a menu that will enable users to read data from a file, write to a file, search a given student, add new students, remove students from the data list, and display all data.
 - **Assignment 06** - The file States.DAT is a binary file of structures, each containing information about one of the fifty United States. Prompt the user for the file name to load the file and transfer data from the file to an array of structures. Give options to sort based on QuickSort or SelectionSort.
